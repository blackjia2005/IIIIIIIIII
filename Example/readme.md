# Example
this example aims to stress the **importance of the model design**, and just for fun!

I think this can be the first Keras project for those who has no experience in coding with tensorflow and Keras
## Files
there are totally 2 files which are model examples and 1 dictionary. Inside the dictionary there is a csv creating python program that can create csvs just for testing and fun. 
the essential part of the python file will be highlighted in the py file.
## Usage
in the ../utils, there is a testing engine that will be used throughout the whole project. this will make training things much  easier, the same as Example, we will use the testing engine.

So the model2 is a simple easy but perfect for the data, so it is easy to train and the loss is approching 0, with only 1 layer of neural network.
In contrast, the model1 has many layers but the loss will stay around 100, and training process is also consuming. 

## Aim
the dictionsry **example** is just for 2 reasons:
 - learn the format of coding with test engine
 - Learn how important the model design is
 - To know, that your computer is capable for small tests of nural network training
